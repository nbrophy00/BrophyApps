    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

    <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the SongBank mobile app for iOS and Android devices. It is published here for reference and transparency, and will also apply to any future services made available through the SongBank website.</p>
        <section class="gray-section">
        <ul>
          <li><a>• SongBank has never sold your information and we never will.</a></li>
          <li><a>• We use your information to fulfill the services and requests you make through our platform.</a></li>
          <li><a>• We also use your information to improve our services and better meet your needs.</a></li>
          <li><a>• Personal information is disclosed externally only when required by law.</a></li>
          <li><a>• For more information, please continue reading below.</a></li>

    <h3>1.2 The Information SongBank Collects and Manages</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>We only collect the personal information that is necessary to operate and improve the SongBank mobile app. Some of this information is provided directly by you—such as when you create an account, request support, or make a purchase. In these cases, we may store your name and contact details. We do not store credit card numbers unless you give explicit permission to do so through one of our secure, in-app payment providers. When you use the SongBank app, we may automatically collect certain technical and usage information, such as how you arrived at the app, which features you interact with, and how you use various parts of the app. This helps us understand usage patterns, improve the app experience, and guide future development. We may also receive your information indirectly. For example, if you sign up using an authentication provider like Google or Apple, or if you’re referred to the app through a partner or affiliate, we may receive your basic contact information in order to complete your request. Similarly, if you engage with our brand on social media—by liking, following, commenting, or mentioning us—we may have access to your public profile information and interactions, even if you later remove them from the platform. We use your information to provide the services you’ve requested, manage your account, and help protect your account from unauthorized access. We also use it to respond to support inquiries, communicate updates about the app, suggest new features you may find useful, invite feedback, and notify you of important policy changes. We analyze user data to better understand your needs and continuously improve the SongBank experience. We only collect and process your information when we have a valid legal reason to do so—typically with your consent or because it’s necessary to deliver a service you requested. In some cases, we rely on our legitimate business interests. You can choose not to share certain types of information by disabling permissions in your device settings or by opting out of specific app features. Note that this may affect how certain parts of the app function. SongBank does not use third-party cookies, and we do not track you across other apps or websites. Access to your personal information is limited to authorized employees and contractors who need it to perform their responsibilities. If we share your information with trusted third parties—such as developers, analytics providers, or support partners—they must meet strict security and data protection requirements and use your information only for the purposes of serving you. While privacy laws vary by location, SongBank commits to honoring your rights regardless of where you live. If you're in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another jurisdiction that grants data subject rights, you may request access to your data, corrections, deletion, or portability. You may also object to certain types of processing or file a complaint with a supervisory authority. We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. When your data is no longer needed, we will securely delete, anonymize, or isolate it, depending on what is most appropriate.</p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>1.3 How SongBank Handles Your Stored Data</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>You retain full ownership of the data you store and manage within the SongBank app. We treat that data as private and confidential, protect it with industry-standard safeguards, and only process it based on your instructions. You can access your data at any time, use approved third-party integrations to share it, or request that we export or permanently delete it. We will retain your data for as long as your SongBank account is active. Once you close your account, your data is immediately removed from our active systems and will be fully deleted from backups within 90 days. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and believe that a third party (such as an employer or service provider) has submitted your personal information to us through the app, you may have rights under applicable data protection laws. In such cases, we ask that you contact the individual or organization who provided your information. We will coordinate with them to address your request in accordance with their instructions and applicable regulations.
    </p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>1.4 Additional Privacy Considerations</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>While we take your privacy seriously, there are some necessary limitations. We may disclose personal information when required by law, in order to prevent fraud, enforce our terms of service, or protect the safety and rights of our users. At present, SongBank does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals from web browsers. Should an industry-wide standard for honoring these signals be established in the future, we will evaluate and adopt it as appropriate. Please note that third-party websites and social media features you may interact with through the app are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies before sharing any personal information, as we are not responsible for how third parties handle your data. You may contact us at any time if you have questions about our privacy practices, need a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, believe we may have collected information from a minor, or would like your personal data removed from any public-facing SongBank features. If we make any significant updates to this privacy policy, or in the unlikely event that we sell or transfer the business, we will notify you and explain how your data may be affected.
