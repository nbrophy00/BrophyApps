    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>At SongBank, your privacy matters. Our goal isn’t to collect your data — it’s to build a powerful platform for artists, songwriters, and music lovers. To make that possible, we do need to gather certain information from you. This Terms of Service explains the rules for using SongBank, including how your information is collected, used, and protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You always have control over your data and can update or manage your information at any time.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

      <p>If you wish to object to the collection, processing, or use of your personal data—either in full or in part as outlined in our Privacy Policy—you may do so at any time by contacting us via email or mail using the details below:</p>

      <h2>2. Our Values</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>We operate under two core values: protecting your privacy and maintaining full transparency in how we handle your data.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>
    
     <p> We’re committed to protecting your privacy. That’s why we handle your data with great care—collecting only the minimum information necessary to operate SongBank effectively. All user data is securely stored and fully encrypted, ensuring the highest level of privacy and protection.</p>
     <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

      <p>We’re equally committed to transparency. You have the right to know exactly why we collect your data and how it’s used. Our goal is to give you full control over your information at all times. If you have any questions about your data or this Privacy Policy, you’re always welcome to reach out to us.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions And Purchases</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Subscriptions and Purchases</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>All SongBank subscriptions are offered exclusively through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We do not sell subscriptions directly through our website or accept payments outside of those platforms. By purchasing a subscription via the App Store or Google Play, you agree to abide by the respective platform’s terms, conditions, and billing policies. SongBank does not control or process your payment details—these are managed securely by Apple or Google, depending on your device. Access to your subscription will begin once your purchase is confirmed by the relevant app store. For questions about billing, renewals, cancellations, or refunds, please refer to Apple or Google’s subscription management settings.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>3.2 Prices and Payment</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>You agree to pay the subscription price as displayed at the time of purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. SongBank may change subscription pricing or offerings from time to time. If the subscription price changes, you will be notified by the respective app store in advance, and you will have the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new rate takes effect if you do not wish to continue at the updated price.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>When you purchase a subscription through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you must provide accurate and valid payment information to the respective platform. By submitting payment details, you confirm that you are authorized to use the selected payment method. All billing authorizations, payment processing, and security checks are handled by Apple or Google. If your payment is declined, revoked, or fails for any reason, your access to the SongBank subscription may be suspended or terminated by the respective app store. SongBank does not collect or store any payment information and does not have access to your billing credentials.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>In addition to your subscription payment, you are responsible for any internet, data, or mobile charges incurred while using the SongBank app. This may include fees from your mobile carrier for data usage, roaming, or other telecommunications services required to access the app and its features.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>All SongBank subscription pricing is managed and displayed by the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. While we make every effort to ensure that pricing shown on promotional materials or within the app is accurate, the final subscription price is determined and charged by the respective app store. In the event of a pricing error, Apple or Google will manage the resolution in accordance with their own policies. SongBank is not obligated to honor pricing that is clearly incorrect or misleading.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>3.3 Renewals and Cancellations</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>After any free trial or initial subscription period, your SongBank subscription will automatically renew on a monthly basis at the rate shown at the time of your original purchase. Renewals and payments are managed entirely through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, using the same payment method linked to your account. If you wish to cancel your subscription or turn off auto-renewal, you must do so directly through your Apple or Google account settings before the next billing cycle begins. SongBank does not have access to your payment information and cannot cancel or modify subscriptions on your behalf.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>After any initial term or free trial period, you may cancel your SongBank subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will retain access to your subscription until that period ends. Please note that partial refunds are not provided for unused portions of the subscription term. To cancel, you must use the subscription management settings provided by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. SongBank cannot cancel subscriptions on your behalf.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>
    
    <h3>3.4 Cancellation by Us</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the SongBank app and its subscription features at any time if we have reason to believe you are engaging in fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity, if you violate these Terms of Service, or if you fail to provide necessary information to maintain your account. Please note that all subscription payments are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. If your payment is declined, canceled, or otherwise disrupted through those platforms, your access to SongBank may be automatically suspended or revoked according to the app store’s policies.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Cancellation by you if there is a problem with the Subscription Service and Complaints.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>If you have any questions or complaints about the product, please contact us at support@songbank-app.com</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>We are legally obligated to provide services that conform to this agreement. Nothing in these Terms of Service affects your statutory rights under applicable consumer protection laws.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>4. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Information We Collect</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by the companies from which users import data, including but not limited to: ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, DistroKid, OneRPM, and Tunecore. Users may import royalty statements from these and other sources to manage their catalogs within the SongBank app. Additionally, we use the Spotify API solely to retrieve and display album artwork based on available metadata. No other data is accessed from Spotify or any third-party service.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>All information we collect is related to delivering and improving the services provided by SongBank. Currently, personal data is collected through the SongBank mobile app on iOS and Android devices. However, in the future, we may offer web-based features—such as a secure “Bulk Statement Import” tool—which may require users to create an account or log in through the SongBank website. If and when such services are made available, the information collected through them will be handled securely and in accordance with this Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>
    
    <p>If we add login functionality to the SongBank website in the future, we may also collect limited technical data—such as your browser type, general location, and access statistics—to support account security and improve site performance.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>In the future, if SongBank introduces social login or integrated account features, we may collect limited data such as your name and email address from those services—but only with your explicit permission. We will never access friend lists, likes, or private content unless clearly required and disclosed for a specific feature.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>SongBank does not collect or store payment information such as credit card numbers, PayPal credentials, or banking details. All subscription transactions are handled securely through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Our website may use basic cookies or similar technologies to improve performance and understand general site usage. We do not use cookies to track personal behavior or serve targeted advertising.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>4.2 Information provided by your Social Networks</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>If SongBank offers social login in the future, you may choose to connect your account using a third-party platform such as Google, Apple, or another supported service. With your explicit permission, we may receive limited information from that platform to help verify your identity and streamline your login experience. This may include your name, email address, profile image, and general location. We will not access your friends list, likes, or other private account data unless clearly required for a specific feature and disclosed at the time of connection.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Any information shared with us through a connected social account is collected and controlled by the respective social network and provided to us in accordance with that platform’s privacy policy. You can manage what information is shared with SongBank by adjusting your privacy settings within your social account at any time.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>If you wish to leave SongBank, you can email us at support@songbank-app.com</p>

    <h2>6. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Sharing by you</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>If in the future you choose to connect your SongBank account with a social network account (such as Facebook or Google), certain activity-related information—such as the content you interact with—may be shared with that network based on your settings and permissions. This information could be associated with your social profile and made visible according to the privacy controls you maintain on that platform. SongBank will provide in-app settings to manage or limit this type of sharing if such functionality becomes available. The connected social network may also offer its own privacy controls.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>You understand and agree that any information collected by a social network—either directly from you or with your authorization—is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and your individual privacy settings on their platform. Any use of that information by SongBank will be subject to this Privacy Policy and the preferences you’ve set within your SongBank account.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>6.2 Sharing by SongBank</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We do not share your information unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>6.3 Your consent</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We share your personal information with others only when we have your consent. For any sharing of sensitive personal data, we require your explicit opt-in approval.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>6.4 Marketing and advertising</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We may share information with advertising partners to deliver promotional communications about SongBank, show you personalized content and relevant ads, and better understand how users interact with advertisements. Any information shared is de-identified—such as through hashing—and does not personally identify you.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>For more information about the cookies and similar technologies we and third parties may use to deliver more relevant ads—as well as your choices for managing them—please see Section 13 below.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>6.5 Service providers and others</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We may occasionally share your information with trusted service providers who help us operate and deliver SongBank, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When a third party processes user data on our behalf—such as a hosting provider—they are contractually required to follow strict security and confidentiality obligations in line with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. If a third party processes user data independently (for example, through their own services or platforms), that processing is governed by their own privacy policy and legal obligations, as previously outlined.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>6.6 Other sharing</h3>

          <li><a>• to respond to legal process (e.g., a court order or subpoena), if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so; to comply with requirements of mandatory applicable law; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the rights and property of SongBank, including to enforce the Terms & Conditions; and to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or</a></li>
          <li><a>• to academic researchers for purposes including statistical analysis and academic study, but only in a de-identified format; or</a></li>
          <li><a>• to publish de-identified or aggregate information about the use of SongBank.</a></li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <div class="terms-spacer-2xl"></div>

    <h2>7. Communicating With Other SongBank Users</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>Please be aware that any personal information you choose to share or display through SongBank’s interactive features—or via linked social networks—may become publicly accessible. You are solely responsible for any information you make public. While we may, at our discretion, monitor user interactions to screen for inappropriate content such as obscenity, defamation, or abuse, we are under no obligation to do so. We reserve the right to remove such content at any time. Additionally, SongBank is not responsible for any outcomes resulting from your decision to communicate or interact with other users in environments or circumstances beyond our control.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information. To help keep your SongBank account secure, we encourage you to use a strong, unique password, avoid sharing it with others, limit access to your device and browser, and log out when you're finished using the app. You should never disclose your password to unauthorized individuals. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect the information we collect. While we take reasonable and industry-standard measures to secure your data, no system is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of user information. In the event we believe that your personal information may have been compromised or is at risk, we will attempt to notify you as promptly as possible. Where appropriate, we may notify you via the email address linked to your SongBank account. By using SongBank, you consent to receiving such notifications by email. If you prefer to be contacted by another method, please let us know!</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>9. Your Preferences And Control</h2>
      <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>We want you to have as much control over your information as possible. While SongBank currently allows you to manage your account by resetting your password, additional profile and privacy settings may be introduced in future updates. We’re committed to giving you clear options for managing your data and preferences as our features grow.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>
    
     <p> Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or applications, including social networks. We do not control how those platforms collect, use, or share your information. Before connecting your SongBank account to any third-party service or sharing your data with them, we recommend reviewing their privacy policies to understand how your information may be handled.</p>
     <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

      <p>We may use third-party services that employ cookies or similar technologies to display personalized ads on our behalf. For information on how to manage or opt out of these interest-based ads, please refer to Section 12 below. Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not eliminate ads entirely—it simply means the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>10. Links</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>We may display advertisements from third parties or content that links to external websites. We do not control the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites and cannot be held responsible for how they handle your personal information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you visit or interact with.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>11. Children</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p>SongBank is not intended for use by children and is not directed toward anyone under the age of 13. Individuals under 13 are not permitted to use the service, register for an account, or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will delete it as promptly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have submitted personal information to us, please contact us immediately at support@songbank-app.com.</p>
      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

     <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>If you choose to delete your account, we will process your request within a reasonable period of time.

      <div class="terms-spacer-3xl"></div>

    <h2>13. Cookies And Similar Technologies</h2>
    <div class="terms-spacer-sm"></div>

    <p> Accepting cookies is not required in order to visit our website. However, like most online services, we use cookies to better understand how users interact with SongBank and to help us improve the services we provide. Certain features may not function properly without the use of cookies. This section explains how we use cookies and provides information on how you can manage or disable them if you choose.</p>

    <h3>13.1 What are cookies</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. There are "persistent" and "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

These cookies would help remember your login status, preferences, and settings—allowing for a more seamless and personalized experience.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>13.3 Third Party Cookies / Similar Technologies</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>In addition to our own basic cookies, we may work with trusted third-party companies to help us understand how SongBank is used and to improve the service we provide. These partners may use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymized usage data on our behalf. The following companies may assist us in this capacity:</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Google Analytics and Google Optimize are services provided by Google LLC (“Google”). These tools use cookies to help us understand how users interact with SongBank and to test different versions of content in order to improve user experience. The information collected by these cookies—including a truncated version of your IP address—is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google uses this information to evaluate usage patterns across our services and to provide aggregated reports on website activity and performance. Your IP address is truncated before being sent, which means it is anonymized and cannot be used by Google to identify you, your device, or your precise location. This level of data is sufficient only to determine an approximate geographic region, such as your country of access.</p>

    <h3>15.1 Usage Policy</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>You agree to use the SongBank services for personal, non-commercial purposes and in a fair and reasonable manner. The services may not be used for any commercial activity. SongBank reserves the right to limit the number of identification attempts or data submissions you make in a given period, or to suspend or terminate your access to the service at any time without prior notice. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of SongBank at our discretion, including specific features, databases, or content. We may also impose limits on certain functionality or restrict your access to parts or all of the service without liability. If such changes result in a complete termination of service, you may be entitled to a partial refund of any fees paid, based on the unused portion of the service. Continued access to SongBank may require you to download and install updated versions of the app, which may introduce new features, remove others, or be subject to new license terms.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>15.2 Legal Protection and Limitations</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>You acknowledge that the SongBank website, mobile applications, and any third-party applications or sites licensed through SongBank are the property of SongBank or its respective licensors. You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to use SongBank and any associated third-party services solely for accessing and using the SongBank services.

You also agree not to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, or attempt to access the source code of SongBank or any third-party application or service.

    <h2>16. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>16.1 Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the SongBank mobile app for iOS and Android devices. It is published here for reference and transparency, and will also apply to any future services made available through the SongBank website.</p>
        <section class="gray-section">
        <ul>
          <li><a>• SongBank has never sold your information and we never will.</a></li>
          <li><a>• We use your information to fulfill the services and requests you make through our platform.</a></li>
          <li><a>• We also use your information to improve our services and better meet your needs.</a></li>
          <li><a>• Personal information is disclosed externally only when required by law.</a></li>

    <h3>16.2 The Information SongBank Collects and Manages</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>We only collect the personal information that is necessary to operate and improve the SongBank mobile app. Some of this information is provided directly by you—such as when you create an account, request support, or make a purchase. In these cases, we may store your name and contact details. We do not store credit card numbers unless you give explicit permission to do so through one of our secure, in-app payment providers. When you use the SongBank app, we may automatically collect certain technical and usage information, such as how you arrived at the app, which features you interact with, and how you use various parts of the app. This helps us understand usage patterns, improve the app experience, and guide future development. We may also receive your information indirectly. For example, if you sign up using an authentication provider like Google or Apple, or if you’re referred to the app through a partner or affiliate, we may receive your basic contact information in order to complete your request. Similarly, if you engage with our brand on social media—by liking, following, commenting, or mentioning us—we may have access to your public profile information and interactions, even if you later remove them from the platform. We use your information to provide the services you’ve requested, manage your account, and help protect your account from unauthorized access. We also use it to respond to support inquiries, communicate updates about the app, suggest new features you may find useful, invite feedback, and notify you of important policy changes. We analyze user data to better understand your needs and continuously improve the SongBank experience. We only collect and process your information when we have a valid legal reason to do so—typically with your consent or because it’s necessary to deliver a service you requested. In some cases, we rely on our legitimate business interests. You can choose not to share certain types of information by disabling permissions in your device settings or by opting out of specific app features. Note that this may affect how certain parts of the app function. SongBank does not use third-party cookies, and we do not track you across other apps or websites. Access to your personal information is limited to authorized employees and contractors who need it to perform their responsibilities. If we share your information with trusted third parties—such as developers, analytics providers, or support partners—they must meet strict security and data protection requirements and use your information only for the purposes of serving you. While privacy laws vary by location, SongBank commits to honoring your rights regardless of where you live. If you're in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another jurisdiction that grants data subject rights, you may request access to your data, corrections, deletion, or portability. You may also object to certain types of processing or file a complaint with a supervisory authority. We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. When your data is no longer needed, we will securely delete, anonymize, or isolate it, depending on what is most appropriate.</p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>16.3 How SongBank Handles Your Stored Data</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>You retain full ownership of the data you store and manage within the SongBank app. We treat that data as private and confidential, protect it with industry-standard safeguards, and only process it based on your instructions. You can access your data at any time, use approved third-party integrations to share it, or request that we export or permanently delete it. We will retain your data for as long as your SongBank account is active. Once you close your account, your data is immediately removed from our active systems and will be fully deleted from backups within 90 days. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and believe that a third party (such as an employer or service provider) has submitted your personal information to us through the app, you may have rights under applicable data protection laws. In such cases, we ask that you contact the individual or organization who provided your information. We will coordinate with them to address your request in accordance with their instructions and applicable regulations.
    </p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>16.4 Additional Privacy Considerations</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>While we take your privacy seriously, there are some necessary limitations. We may disclose personal information when required by law, in order to prevent fraud, enforce our terms of service, or protect the safety and rights of our users. At present, SongBank does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals from web browsers. Should an industry-wide standard for honoring these signals be established in the future, we will evaluate and adopt it as appropriate. Please note that third-party websites and social media features you may interact with through the app are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies before sharing any personal information, as we are not responsible for how third parties handle your data. You may contact us at any time if you have questions about our privacy practices, need a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, believe we may have collected information from a minor, or would like your personal data removed from any public-facing SongBank features. If we make any significant updates to this privacy policy, or in the unlikely event that we sell or transfer the business, we will notify you and explain how your data may be affected.
