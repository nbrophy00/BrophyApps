This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and secure your information when you use SongBank and how you are always able to control and update your information. Any information provided by you will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>2. Our Principles</h2>

      <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>
    
     <p> We are committed to ensure that your privacy is protected. Therefore, we are very careful with user-data, only saving the very least of information we need to be able to fully operate. All data is fully enclosed and encrypted, providing you with the highest level of privacy security possible.</p>
     <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

      <p>We are committed to ensure that you know exactly why we need your data and what is happening with the information we collect. You should have full control over your information.

    <h2>3. Subscriptions And Purchases</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Subscriptions and Purchases</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>The terms and conditions set out in these terms and conditions apply only to Subscriptions taken out directly via our website www.songbank-app.com (the “Site”). By placing an order for the Subscription, you warrant that: you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and you are at least 18 years old.By submitting your payment and other subscription details, you are making an offer to us to buy the Subscription. Your offer will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have successfully verified your details, at which point we will provide you with access to your Subscription. We reserve the right to reject any offer in our discretion, for any or no reason.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>3.2 Prices and Payment</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>You agree to pay the price at the rate notified to you at the time you take out your Subscription. We may modify the price of any Subscription, remove and/or offer certain other subscription services from time to time. We will always tell you in advance of any increase in the price of your Subscription and offer you an opportunity to cancel it if you do not wish to pay the new price.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>When you subscribe you must provide us with complete and accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise that you are entitled to purchase a Subscription using those payment details. If we do not receive payment authorisation from the card issuer or bank or any authorisation is subsequently cancelled, we will not accept your order and we may immediately terminate or suspend your access to your Subscription and may in suspicious circumstances contact the card issuer or bank and/or law enforcement authorities or other appropriate third parties.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>In addition to the Subscription payment, you are responsible for paying any internet connection or other telecommunications charges that you may incur by accessing the App or using the services available on it. For example, your mobile network operator may charge you for data or roaming services.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, the Subscription prices listed on the Site may be incorrectly priced. If we discover a pricing error, we will inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Subscription at the correct price or cancelling your order. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you by email. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Subscription to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>

    <h3>3.3 Renewals and Cancellations</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>After any minimum term or free-trial period specified in the order process your Subscription will automatically renew monthly at the rate notified to you at the time you take out your Subscription. We will take payment using the same card or other payment method that you previously used or supplied to us in the order process.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>After any minimum term specified in the order process that applies to your Subscription, you may cancel your Subscription at any time and cancellation will only take effect at the next payment date. There are no refunds for unused parts of your Subscription. You may cancel your Subscription from the Subscription Management screen.</p>
    <div class="terms-spacer-lg"></div>
    
    <h3>3.4 Cancellation by Us</h3>
    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

    <p>We may end your Subscription at any time by writing to you if (i) you do not make any payment to us when it is due and you still do not make payment within 14 days of us reminding you that payment is due; (ii) you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the Subscription; (iii) we have reason to believe you have been acting fraudulently.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>Cancellation by you if there is a problem with the Subscription Service and Complaints.</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>If you have any questions or complaints about the product, please contact us at support@songbank-app.com</p> 
    <div class="terms-spacer-xl"></div>

    <p>We are under a legal duty to supply products that are in conformity with this contract. Nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights.</p>

    <h2>16. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>16.1 SongBank Privacy Commitment</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>This is our new privacy policy that covers every SongBank website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites.</p>
        <section class="gray-section">
        <ul>
          <li><a>• SongBank has never sold your information and we never will.</a></li></li>
          <li><a>• We use your information to carry out requests you make of our business.</a></li>
          <li><a>• We use your information to make our business better able to serve you.</a></li>

    <h3>16.2 Information SongBank Collects And Controls</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways). When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development. Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site. We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services. We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests. You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all SongBank websites and products. We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you. The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain). SongBank undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live. We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>16.3 Information That SongBank Processes On Your Behalf</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it. We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use SongBank Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database immediately and from our backups within 3 months after that. If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data. To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.
    </p>

    <div class="spacer-lg"></div>
    <h3>16.4 General</h3>
    <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
    <p>There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it. Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties. You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums. We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>

    <div class="terms-spacer-md"></div>

This action is in addition to our API Client's standard procedures for deleting stored data. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our API Client's privacy practices, especially with regards to the use of Authorized Data, you can contact us at support@songbank-app.com. We are committed to addressing your concerns and ensuring the protection of your privacy.</p>
